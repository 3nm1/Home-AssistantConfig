# Water Meter
#
# This is device that is attached to my water meter. It has a little rotating
# indicator, that rotates exactly once for each liter of water used.
#
# Using an inductive sensor, it can determine the water usage, as each pulse
# now becomes a liter of water. Providing me current usage flow in L/min and
# the total usage registered (in M3).
#
# Originally bought on: https://watermeterkit.nl
# But created my own ESPHome firmware for it (which is what you are looking at).
#
# The blue LED tells the device is powered on (built-in on the Wemos D1 mini).
# The green LED blinks when a pulse is measures (each liter of water used).
# The red LED shows if there is a problem:
# - Blinks slow (once a second): Connection disrupted
# - Blinks fast: ESPHome has an error settings up
# - Off: All fine!
