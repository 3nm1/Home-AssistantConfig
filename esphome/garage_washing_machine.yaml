# Garage Washing Machine
#
# The washing machine in my garage is hooked up to an Sonoff POW R2.
#
# Right now, it just sends out power data to Home Assistant. I do have a
# small binary sensor, that can tell if the machine is "on"/standby.
#
# In the future I want to get power profiles and actually tell what the
# state of the machine is.
